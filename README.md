# Statistics Concepts
 __Descriptive statistics__
- It is a branch of statistics that deals with summarizing, organizing, and presenting data in a meaningful and informative way.
- Its primary goal is to describe and understand the main features of a dataset without making any inferences or generalizations to a larger population.
- Descriptive statistics is often the first step in data analysis and is crucial for gaining insights into the underlying patterns, trends, and characteristics of the data.
- Descriptive statistics are brief informational coefficients that summarize a given data set, which can be either a representation of the entire population or a sample of a population
- Descriptive statistics consists of three basic categories of measures:
  1) __measures of central tendency__ :These measures provide information about the center or typical value of a dataset.
      - Mean: The arithmetic average of all data points in the dataset.
      - Median: The middle value in a sorted dataset, separating the higher and lower values.
      - Mode: The value that appears most frequently in the dataset.
  2) __measures of variability (or spread)__ :These measures indicate the spread or variability of data points around the central tendency. 
      - Variance: A measure of how much the values in the dataset differ from the mean.
      - Standard Deviation: The square root of the variance, which provides a more interpretable measure of dispersion.
  3)  __frequency distribution(table).__ :These tables show the number of occurrences of different values or categories in the dataset.
- Let take one example  to understand in better way :
  
  | Attempt | marks |
  | :---: | :---: |
  |  1    | 65|
  |  2    | 60|
  |  3    | 50|
  |  4    | 55|
  |  5    | 80|
  |  6    | 60|
  |  7    | 75|
  |  8    | 60|

  __1)mean =__  (sum of all Values)/ (total number of Values)  = 65+60+50+55+80+60+75+60 / 8 = __63.12__
  
  __2)Median =__ (sort  all number and  find the middle value) =  i.e __60__
  
  __3)Mode =__ (find most frequently occurring value )= i.e __60__
  
  | Attempt | marks | marks - mean|(marks - mean)^2|
  | :---: | :---: |:---: |:---: |
  |  1    | 65| 5 |25|
  |  2    | 60| 0|0|
  |  3    | 50|10|100|
  |  4    | 55|5|25|
  |  5    | 80|20|400|
  |  6    | 60|0|0|
  |  7    | 75|15|225|
  |  8    | 60|0|0|
  
  __4)Variance :__ (find the mean first, then compute the squared difference between each score and the mean) i.e 25+100+25+400+225/8 =96
  
  __5)Standard Deviation:__ The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. âˆš(96) =9.79
